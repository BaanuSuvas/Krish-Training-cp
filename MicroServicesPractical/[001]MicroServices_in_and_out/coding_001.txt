Micro services are all about deploying component as a service. Service can talk to each component and get the final job done. Spring Cloud and Spring Boot framework helps to develop MS.
Spring cloud
Open source framework, capable to run and deploy anywhere (cloud or own data center).
Spring Boot
Convention over Configuration – E.g.: Property file should place is the place which is allocated for property. Call it as convention.
Dependency management made simple – can use maven or what ever 
IDEA – IntellIJ IDEA or Eclipse , Spring STS is a spring Idea
We have controller, service and repository.
Controller is responsible to handle the traffic ( do the required service). It is a last layer which is handling the exception in the spring environment. 
Service is to hold the business logic. It maintains the state. Example: generate new session.
Repository is deal with database ( database query, crud operation ).
